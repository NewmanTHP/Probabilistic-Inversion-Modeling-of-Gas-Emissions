        - "Exploratory Data Analysis" determining the atmospheric stability class at time of the Chilbolton dataset measurements. Corresponds to Supplementary Material B.2.4.

        - "Inversion"  Manifold Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm within Gibbs (M-MALA-within-Gibbs) parameter estimation for Source 1, Source 2, Source 3 and Source 4 from the Chilbolton dataset. Corresponds to Section 5 in the main paper and Supplementary Material B.2.5, B.2.6, and B.2.7.
    

    "Simulation Study" contains all the notebooks for the simulation study. Corresponds to Section 4 in the main paper and Supplementary Material B.1.

        - "Simulation Study Code.ipynb" this notebook was used to produce all the results of Section 4 in the main paper. 

        - "Simulation Study Plots.ipynb" this notebook was used to produce all the plots of Section 4 in the main paper and in Supplementary Material B.1. 



Data:
    "Chilbolton_data_files" contains preprocessed .txt and postprocessed .pkl files of Chilbolton CH4 measurements and wind fields.

        - "Preprocessed" .txt files for each controlled release measurements and wind field.

        - "Postprocessed" .pkl files of (1) laser dispersion spectrometer measurements for Source 1, Source 2, Source 3, and Source 4 emissions, (2) reflector locations, (3) corresponding wind fields, and (4) source emission rates and locations.
    

    "MCMC_chains" Chilbolton case study and simulation study samples of source emission rate, location, background gas concentration, measurement error variance and Gaussian plume dispersion parameters (for the non atmospheric stability class-based models).

        - "Chilbolton_case_study" sample chains for atmospheric stability class-based models (Smith and Briggs parametrizations) and non atmospheric stability class-based models (est. Draxler and est. Smith parametrizations) for Source 1, Source 2, Source 3, and Source 4 datasets.

        - "Simulation_study" sample chains for (1) varying parameters (a) WDC: wind direction coverage [degreesÂ°], (b) DPV: dispersion parameter values, (c) SER: source emission rate [kg/s], (d) DTS: distance between the source and sensors [m], (e) OPS: number of observations per sensor, and (f) SL: sensor layout. And in-depth study of wind direction coverages and sensor layouts; (2) estimating dispersion parameters vs fixing them based on the atmospheric stability class.
