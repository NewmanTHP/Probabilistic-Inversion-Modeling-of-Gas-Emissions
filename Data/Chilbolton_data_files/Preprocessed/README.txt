DESCRIPTION OF FOLDER TREE:
Data are organized by date. The folder naming format is YYYYMMDD.
In each date folder, the data are organized by release number. The subfolder format is "relNN" where NN goes from 01 to 17. A subfolder named "weight data" contain the data of the cylinder mass versus time for each day.

DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA FILES:
In each "relNN" folder are the actual data files. The naming convention is "POSi_relNN_processed.txt" where i goes from 1 to 7 and indicates the beam path reference.
The file is ascii, the data are organized in columns. The first 13 lines contains file inforamtion. The 14th line contains the column descriptors (physical quantity and units). The data column record starts at line 15.
In addition for quick visualization the file "relNN_results_plots.png" is a graph picture of the data.
The data contained in the "weight data" folder are in CSV format. The data indicates the mass of the cylinder in kg as function of time.
