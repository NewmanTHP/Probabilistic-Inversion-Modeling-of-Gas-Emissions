DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA FILES:
------------------------------

"Chilbolton_CH4_measurments_source_3and4.pkl":

Contains all sensor-reflector pair's Source 3 and Source 4 simultaneous release path-averaged CH4 measurements. The Gaussian plume model
poorly represents gas dispersion over short time frames. However, when averaged over an extended period, its accuracy significantly improves.
Consequently, measurements from each beam in the "Data/Chilbolton_case_study/Chilbolton_data_files/Preprocessed/.../Clean_data" folder,
taken every 3 seconds, were aggregated within 1-minute intervals.


"Chilbolton_windfield_source_3and4.pkl":

Contains the windfield data (wind speed, wind direction, and rolling standard deviation of the horizontal and vertical wind
direction time series) matching "Chilbolton_CH4_measurments_source_3and4.pkl".
